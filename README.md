# Girl Develop It Self-Assessments

Not sure whether you're ready to jump in to the next GDI class? We have a variety of self-assessments to see if you're ready for what we're teaching.

## Intro to Sass

To get the most out of this class, you should have a working knowledge of HTML & CSS. You may have taken Intro to HTML or HTML5/CSS3 through Girl Develop It, and have built your own site or already build websites regularly. You're comfortable with writing CSS already and are ready to take your skills to the next level. 

A 7 out of 10 score means you qualify to take this class. You should also have at least a passing familiarity with opening and using the Terminal or Command Line on your preferred operating system.

## Intermediate HTML and CSS

It is highly recommended that you take our introductory course (or have previous experience with HTML & CSS) prior to taking this class. Basic knowledge of HTML and CSS are assumed.
